### Option 1: Use the Deployed Version (Easiest)

1. **Get the Streamlit Cloud URL** from the developer
2. **Open the URL** in your browser
3. **The API key is already configured** - just start chatting!

### Option 2: Run Locally with Shared API Key

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_shared_api_key_here"

# On Windows:
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_shared_api_key_here
```

**Method B: Create .env file**
1. Copy `env_example.txt` to `.env`
2. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with the actual API key
3. Install python-dotenv: `pip install python-dotenv`

#### Step 4: Run the App
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

#### Step 5: Open in Browser
Go to `http://localhost:8501` and start chatting!

## üí° Tips for Testing

Try asking questions like:
- "What services does the Office of Student Affairs provide?"
- "Tell me about J-Term at CBS"
- "What are the core courses?"
- "Where can I find coffee near campus?"
- "What are the campus resources available?"

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**If you get an error about missing API key:**
- Make sure you've set the environment variable correctly
- Check that the .env file exists and has the correct API key
- Restart your terminal/command prompt after setting environment variables

**If the app doesn't load:**
- Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
