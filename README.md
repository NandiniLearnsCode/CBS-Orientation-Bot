# ðŸ¦™ðŸ“š Columbia Business School Orientation Chatbot

Columbia Business School Orientation chatbot Copilot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to answer questions from students during orientation. It leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4o and LlamaIndex to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses based on the data it has been trained on.

## Overview of the App

- Takes user queries via Streamlit's `st.chat_input` and displays both user queries and model responses with `st.chat_message`.
- Use `Copilot` class to interact with the chatbot by passing in a question and a list of messages and get a response.
- Uses LlamaIndex to load and index data and create a Retriever to retrieve context from that data to respond to each user query.
- **NEW**: Supports multiple PDFs and website content for comprehensive CBS information.

## Data Sources

The bot uses information from:
- Multiple PDF documents in the `data/` folder
- CBS Office of Student Affairs website: https://students.business.columbia.edu/office-of-student-affairs
